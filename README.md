Danganronpa Waifu Wars is a site that aims to offer an RPG-like Danganronpa experience for the web. You can choose and select waifus, form a party (a *harem*), and battle against other waifu parties/*harems*.

This project was developed in my spare time to practice and test out my skills in Angular.
